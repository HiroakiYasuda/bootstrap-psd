# [Bootstrap v3.0.0 PSD](http://designshock.com)

Bootstrap 3.0.0 PSD is the PhotoShop interface of the latest version (3.0.0) of
Bootstrap. It is created by [DesignShock](http://designshock.com) and includes all the elements in the documentation. It's intended for designers who aren't necessarily into CSS
but want to use Bootstrap elements in their own projects.

All the elements in this PSD are carefully layered, and organized by sections and components
as those in the documentation, so that you can find everything the easiest way.

## Layers

It is very easy to find elements, as they organized following documentation sections and components.
You can find more previews of the PSD in [this article](http://designshock.com/).
